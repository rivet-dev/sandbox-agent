Use the filesystem API to upload files, then reference them as attachments when sending prompts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a file">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```ts TypeScript
    import { SandboxAgentClient } from "sandbox-agent";
    import fs from "node:fs";

    const client = new SandboxAgentClient({
      baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:2468",
      token: process.env.SANDBOX_TOKEN,
      agent: "mock",
      });

    const buffer = await fs.promises.readFile("./data.csv");

    const upload = await client.writeFsFile(
      { path: "./uploads/data.csv", sessionId: "my-session" },
      buffer,
    );

    console.log(upload.path);
    ```

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:2468/v1/fs/file?path=./uploads/data.csv&sessionId=my-session" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $SANDBOX_TOKEN" \
      --data-binary @./data.csv
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The response returns the absolute path that you should use for attachments.

  <Step title="Attach the file in a prompt">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```ts TypeScript
    import { SandboxAgentClient } from "sandbox-agent";

    const client = new SandboxAgentClient({
      baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:2468",
      token: process.env.SANDBOX_TOKEN,
      agent: "mock",
      });

    await client.postMessage("my-session", {
      message: "Please analyze the attached CSV.",
      attachments: [
        {
          path: "/home/sandbox/uploads/data.csv",
          mime: "text/csv",
          filename: "data.csv",
        },
      ],
    });
    ```

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:2468/v1/sessions/my-session/messages" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $SANDBOX_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "message": "Please analyze the attached CSV.",
        "attachments": [
          {
            "path": "/home/sandbox/uploads/data.csv",
            "mime": "text/csv",
            "filename": "data.csv"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

- Use absolute paths from the upload response to avoid ambiguity.
- If `mime` is omitted, the server defaults to `application/octet-stream`.
- OpenCode receives file parts directly; other agents will see the attachment paths appended to the prompt.
