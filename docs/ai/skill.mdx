Mintlify hosts a `skill.md` file for this documentation site.

Access it at:

```
https://sandboxagent.dev/docs/skill.md
```

To add it to an agent using the Skills CLI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npx">
    ```bash
    npx skills add rivet-dev/skills -s sandbox-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bunx">
    ```bash
    bunx skills add rivet-dev/skills -s sandbox-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you run a reverse proxy in front of the docs, make sure `/skill.md` and `/.well-known/skills/*`
are forwarded to Mintlify.
