# Instructions

## Naming and Ownership

- This repository/product is **Sandbox Agent**.
- **Gigacode** is a separate user-facing UI/client, not the server product name.
- Gigacode integrates with Sandbox Agent via the OpenCode-compatible surface (`/opencode/*`) when that compatibility layer is enabled.
- Canonical extension namespace/domain string is `sandboxagent.dev` (no hyphen).
- Canonical custom ACP extension method prefix is `_sandboxagent/...` (no hyphen).

## Docs Terminology

- Never mention "ACP" in user-facing docs (`docs/**/*.mdx`) except in docs that are specifically about ACP itself (e.g. `docs/acp-http-client.mdx`).
- Never expose underlying protocol method names (e.g. `session/request_permission`, `session/create`, `_sandboxagent/session/detach`) in non-ACP docs. Describe the behavior in user-facing terms instead.
- Do not describe the underlying protocol implementation in docs. Only document the SDK surface (methods, types, options). ACP protocol details belong exclusively in ACP-specific pages.
- Do not use em dashes (`—`) in docs. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.

### Docs Source Of Truth (HTTP/CLI)

- For HTTP/CLI docs/examples, source of truth is:
  - `server/packages/sandbox-agent/src/router.rs`
  - `server/packages/sandbox-agent/src/cli.rs`
- Keep docs aligned to implemented endpoints/commands only (for example ACP under `/v1/acp`, not legacy `/v1/sessions` APIs).

## Change Tracking

- If the user asks to "push" changes, treat that as permission to commit and push all current workspace changes, not a hand-picked subset, unless the user explicitly scopes the push.
- Keep CLI subcommands and HTTP endpoints in sync.
- Update `docs/cli.mdx` when CLI behavior changes.
- Regenerate `docs/openapi.json` when HTTP contracts change.
- Keep `docs/inspector.mdx` and `docs/sdks/typescript.mdx` aligned with implementation.
- Append blockers/decisions to `research/acp/friction.md` during ACP work.
- `docs/agent-capabilities.mdx` lists models/modes/thought levels per agent. Update it when adding a new agent or changing `fallback_config_options`. If its "Last updated" date is >2 weeks old, re-run `cd scripts/agent-configs && npx tsx dump.ts` and update the doc to match. Source data: `scripts/agent-configs/resources/*.json` and hardcoded entries in `server/packages/sandbox-agent/src/router/support.rs` (`fallback_config_options`).
- Some agent models are gated by subscription (e.g. Claude `opus`). The live report only shows models available to the current credentials. The static doc and JSON resource files should list all known models regardless of subscription tier.

## Install Version References

- Channel policy:
  - Sandbox Agent install/version references use a pinned minor channel `0.N.x` (for curl URLs and `sandbox-agent` / `@sandbox-agent/cli` npm/bun installs).
  - Gigacode install/version references use `latest` (for `@sandbox-agent/gigacode` install/run commands and `gigacode-install.*` release promotion).
  - Release promotion policy: `latest` releases must still update `latest`; when a release is `latest`, Sandbox Agent must also be promoted to the matching minor channel `0.N.x`.
- Keep every install-version reference below in sync whenever versions/channels change:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/acp-http-client.mdx`
  - `docs/cli.mdx`
  - `docs/quickstart.mdx`
